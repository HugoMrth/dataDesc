### 2) Purpose

The aim of this package is to conduct exploratory and descriptive analysis of a data base. 
The first step would be to compute metadata of the dataset according to the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) guidelines. 
Once one acquires a deeper knowledge of the data, the second step would be to conduct univarite and bivariate analysis in order to prepare for a more in depth exploration.
